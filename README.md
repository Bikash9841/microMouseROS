# microMouseROS
A maze solving robot made using two magnetic encoder motors, 4 time-of-flight sensors and stm32 microcontroller. It can solve a unknown 16*16 maze completely by itself using modified floodfill algorithm and finds the shortest path from start to the centre of the maze. It uses PID control mechanism for 
smooth traversal inside the maze.
