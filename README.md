## Maze Solving Robot- Micromouse
    • It is a differential wheeled robot made to solve a 16*16 maze.
    • Used Modified Floodfill Algorithm for path planning and PID control mechanism.
    • STM32 BluePill, Encoder motors and TOF sensors are used.
    • Used Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo for simulation purposes.
